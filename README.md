# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Using_ML
This project predicts heart disease using machine learning models based on patient medical data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and training multiple classifiers like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest. The system identifies high-risk patients and demonstrates how ML supports early diagnosis in healthcare.
