Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prediction can help in taking preventive measures.
This project uses machine learning classification models to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.

The model is trained on a structured dataset and evaluated using multiple ML techniques to find the best-performing algorithm.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze heart disease dataset and perform preprocessing
Train multiple machine learning models
Evaluate and compare model performance
Build a final predictive model
Provide insights using visualizations

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes
Gradient Boosting / XGBoost (if used)
